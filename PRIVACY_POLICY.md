# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 4, 2025_

## 1. Introduction

Darkdown ("the Add-on") is a free and open-source Google Docs to Markdown converter. This Privacy Policy explains how Darkdown interacts with your data when you use the Add-on.

## 2. Information We Collect

Darkdown does **not** collect or store any personal data. When you use the Add-on:

- It accesses only the active Google Document (and its comments) to perform the conversion.
- All processing is done within your Google Docs environment.
- No document content is transmitted to any external servers or stored beyond the conversion process.

## 3. Use of Data

The data accessed (including document text and comments) is used solely to generate the Markdown output. It is not shared, stored, or used for any other purpose.

## 4. Data Security

Since Darkdown operates directly within your Google Docs environment using Google Apps Script, your data remains under your account’s protection and is subject to Google’s security measures. We take no further responsibility for data security beyond the conversion process.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Darkdown does not employ third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. All processing is done using built-in Google APIs and the Apps Script runtime.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the "Last updated" date will be revised, and the updated policy will be posted in this file.
